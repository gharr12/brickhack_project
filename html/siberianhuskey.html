                We give all our puppy owners a pdf copy of our handbook to help them give their pups the best possible life one could give. Canines cannot speak or choose on their behalf, so it is up to the human guardian of that canine to make the choices and life decisions for them. As times change and research gets more in depth in regards to canines, we now understand alot of the old ideology in regards to raising and caring for a canines to be obsolete. More and more studies are continually being done that are finally challenging alot of what dog owners were once led to believe. It is up to the human guardians to be as informed as possible to ensure we are providing the best possible life for our canine companions. This handbook provides information on almost every canine subject imagineable. We as owners need to take resposnibilty for how we raise our pups and for the life we provide them. For every action, or lack of action there is a reaction that manifests within our pups health. Sometimes being a immediate reaction, and in most cases a long term reaction that manifests when it is too late to correct. Staying educated and informed is the only way that a human guardian can properely care for their canine soulmate.
