            We are eagerly awaiting our lovely Danica (MBIF DC Windrock Born To Run SC Fch) to come into season. She should come in the latter part of Febuary and hopefully we would be blessed with April puppies. Superstar Bekka (MBIS/MBISS Ch Mandajors Highly Explosive at Windrock RN) is also due to come in early spring. If all goes to accourding to plan, we should have lots of happy puppies galloping around the place this summer!
        These puppies will be the result of over three decades of our dedication and involvement in breeding superior dogs. Click the button below to buy!
